excerpt: 'To evaluate effectiveness of a counterfactual policy, it is usually necessary to extrapolate the treatment effects on compliers to broader populations. This extrapolation relies on exogeneous variation in instruments, which is often weak in practice. To address this limitation, researchers often use additional variation from covariates for identification by making an additive separability assumption, which requires that the causal effects of covariates do not vary with unobserved heterogeneity. However, this is typically considered to be a strong assumption. Indeed, I show that failure of additive separability can lead to biased estimates with wrong signs. Consequently, I develop inference results that do not depend on additive separability, while also recognizing the potential weakness of instruments. These methods lead to asymptotically valid confidence sets for various linear functionals of marginal treatment effects, including LATE, ATE, ATT, and policy-relevant treatment effects, regardless of identification strength. Furthermore, the coverage is exact under a class of linear marginal treatment response functions. Finally, I use my results to reanalyze the effect of non-prosecution on defendant's future criminal activities from Agan, Doleac, and Harvey (2023).'
